# P5js Factory

A CLI tool to bootstrap a new [p5js](https://p5js.org/) project.

The goal of this tool is to automate the starting process of a p5js project. It downloads the latest release of p5js and creates a project folder with all the necessary files to run a p5js sketch.

### Installation

Install the package globally with npm.

```
npm install -g p5js-factory
```

After the install, run:

```
p5js-factory
```

Running the command will execute the script to bootstrap the p5js project. It will ask for a folder name, then it will download the necessary files and create the project.

With the project created you can start tinkering away with p5js.
